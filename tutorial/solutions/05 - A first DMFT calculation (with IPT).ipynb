    "A first DMFT calculation\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to make a first DMFT calculation using the iterated perturbation theory (IPT) to solve the impurity problem.\n",
    "You will proceed in two steps: first you will set up the IPT\n",
    "impurity solver and then you will set up the DMFT loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterated perturbation theory\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPT is a cheap way to solve the impurity problem which is restricted\n",
    "to half-filling. It approximates the self-energy by second-order\n",
    "perturbation theory, just like in the last exercise of the notebook\n",
    "on Green's functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Sigma(i\\omega_n) = \\frac{U}{2} + U^2 \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau e^{i \\omega_n \\tau} {\\cal G}_0(\\tau)^3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first term, $\\frac{U}{2}$, is the chemical potential $\\mu$ for half-filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "An impurity solver takes a non-interacting Green's function $G_0$, an impurity interaction $U$ and an inverse temperature $\\beta$ as an input and returns the interacting Green's function $G$ as well as the\n",
    "self-energy $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes $U$, $\\beta$ and ${\\cal G}_0(i\\omega)$ as an input and returns the second order perturbation theory result for $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$ as well as the corresponding $G(i\\omega)$. It could\n",
    "have the following structure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function solve\n",
    "def solve(U, G0, beta):\n",
    "    # code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are more familiar with python, you can write a `Solver` class that is constructed with $\\beta$.\n",
    "The class should contain a class member `G0` that is to be initialized by the user.\n",
    "It should further contain a member function `solve` that, given the interaction $U$, sets the class members $G$ and $\\Sigma$ to the results. \n",
    "The advantage of using a class is that Green's functions will not have to be constructed at every call of the\n",
    "function `solve`. The class could have this structure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Class version\n",
    "class IPTSolver:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, beta):\n",
    "        #define member self.g, self.sigma, self.g0\n",
    "        #the user of this class will then set the value of g0 (using <<) before calling solve\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #code here\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    def solve(self,U):\n",
    "        #code here\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPT only works at half-filling, which corresponds to $\\mu=U/2$. It is however common practice to shift both the self-energy and $\\mu$ by $-U/2$ (keeping $G$ unchanged). This way $\\mu=0$ corresponds to the half-filled case, and the self-energy only consists of the second term in the IPT equation."
